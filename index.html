            <p> This visualization is used to raise awareness against the pandemic and is made with the help
              of a chloropeth map which uses the <span style="color: #045a8d">confirmed cases per million people</span>. This helps to see the 
              efforts and measures taken by some country to reduce the spread to their population , which 
              wouldnt have been noted if only the number of affected people were taken into account.It is seen 
              that <span style="color: #045a8d">India</span> and <span style="color: #045a8d">China </span>evennthough having the most population are having a low cases/million ratio
              which shows their efficiency in trying to reduse the spread.It is also worth mentioning that the 
              countries like <span style="color: #045a8d">USA,Kuwait and all the South American countries</span> have been severly affected by Covid-19
              as most of their population is affected by the virus.The data used for this visualization was last 
              updated on 30/10/2020.

            <p>This graph visualizes the distribution of death rates in the United States of America from the data available on a total of 7,000,000 infected people.
              It is seen that children and teenagers developed a better immuntiy to the virus as most of them recovered, where as people above the age of <span style="color: #045a8d">85+</span> are more prone to death so they should be taken care of with extra precautions.
In general, the more the age of the patient, the more He/She is prone to death.Thus , people above <span style="color: #045a8d">50 years</span> of age should be taken care of with extra precautions , reducing their contact with others as they belong to a high risk category.

           <p>This visualisation provides the patterns noticed in the spread of covid-19 to different age groups and genders in the United States of America.
             It can be observed from the chart that people between<span style="color: #045a8d">40-49</span> years and <span style="color: #045a8d">60-69 </span>years old have the highest risk of being infected by the virus.
             It can also be noted that <span style="color: #7fcdbb">females </span>have a slightly increased chance of being infected than <span style="color: #225ea8">males</span> but the risk of being affected are closely similar.

               This area chart is used to visualize the contribution of different continents to the total number of confirmed cases in the world. It can be seen that most of the continents marked their uncontrollable spread during the end of May. The highest contribution to the confirmed cases is by <span style="color: #c7e9b4">North America</span> and <span style="color: #ffffcc">South America</span> in the respective order even though the virus initially originated in <span style="color: #67a9cf">Asia</span>.
<span style="color: #67a9cf">Asia</span> had been reporting cases from the start of the year and the delay in the spread in different continents can be identified by the relative the distance between the continents from <span style="color: #67a9cf">Asia</span>.
It is also worth mentioning that <span style="color: #999999">Oceania</span> have been most effective in reducing cases as they are mostly comprised of island countries.

            <p> This chart visualizes the relation between the confirmed cases and the number of deaths for each country.The countries are represented by circles whose size represents the recovered cases of that country.
              It is seen that most of the countries are belove the general slope of the graph ,which is a good sign as their death rates are comparatively smaller than the average death rate for their confirmed cases as countries with higher population will tend to have higher deaths and recovery numbers.The countries are categorized by regions and it is seen that there is no particular patterns to be observed from this category and it depends on the population of the country. The data used for this visualization was last updated on August 2020.
